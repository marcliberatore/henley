henley
======

A GUI for a text generator similar to the one in the book Ansi Common Lisp, by Paul Graham. 

Useful primarily as an illustration of one particular way of building Swing-based apps in Clojure with a visual form designer.

Updated for more recent (c. 2013) versions of Clojure.

for more details.
